# Explanation for the website

Our team embarked on the task of recreating our university's open house website using WordPress. This week, we focused on 
setting up PHP with XAMPP and began making initial modifications to the WordPress theme using VS Code. The team's 
overarching goal is to enhance the website's appeal, increase acceptance rates by 5%, and boost open house attendance 
by 10% during January 8-14, 2024. Our progress involved gradual testing and adjustments, with the code for the home 
page (index.php) taking shape. We incorporated key sections such as the introduction, events schedule, highlights, and 
contact information. To ensure dynamic content, we plan to leverage WordPress functionalities for event display and 
dynamic contact information. Furthermore, we aim to enhance the website's aesthetics by integrating styles seamlessly 
and ensuring responsiveness across various devices. The team is mindful of the importance of structured HTML tags for 
improved semantic structure and better SEO. As we move forward, our focus will remain on refining the user experience,
addressing specific requirements, and continuously testing and optimizing our WordPress theme. This learning journey 
is not just about coding; it's about strategizing to achieve specific goals, applying best practices, and embracing 
a dynamic and collaborative approach to website development.

The University Open House website serves as a dynamic and interactive platform designed to provide a comprehensive and 
engaging experience for prospective students and their families. Through thoughtful design, informative content,
and user-friendly functionalities, the website aims to showcase the university's offerings, facilitate exploration, and 
ultimately increase acceptance rates and open house attendance.
