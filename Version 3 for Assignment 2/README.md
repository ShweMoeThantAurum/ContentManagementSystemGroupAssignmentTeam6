# Getting Started
 
This repository details how our group (team 6) creates a website, including front-end deployment and back-end deployment.
 
# Explanation for the website

The final Open House website is a meticulously crafted platform designed to provide a seamless and engaging experience for 
event attendees. Our overarching goal was to create a user-friendly space that not only met the functional requirements
but also embodied the spirit and essence of James Cook University.


**Key Features and Objectives:**
* Smart Registration Process: The inclusion of a prominent "Register Now" button serves as a direct pathway to achieving 
our measurable objective of increasing event participation. This feature streamlines the registration process for attendees. 
* Strategic Call-to-Action Buttons: Throughout the website, strategic call-to-action buttons have been strategically
placed to guide users effectively, ensuring a user-friendly experience and supporting our goal of creating a specific and engaging platform. 
* Event Schedule Calendar: The inclusion of an event schedule calendar contributes to the measurable and time-bound 
aspects of our objectives. It offers a clear roadmap for attendees during the Open House week, helping them navigate and plan their participation. 
* Student Videos for Authenticity: Incorporating student videos adds a relevant and authentic touch to the website, 
enhancing our goal of creating a platform that resonates with prospective students. These videos provide firsthand insights into the student experience, fostering a connection with potential attendees. 
* Real-Time Website Updates: One standout feature is the website's ability to be updated live. This demonstrates 
our proficiency in real-time updates, allowing for dynamic changes and timely dissemination of information. 
* Challenges and Solutions: While developing the Open House website, our team encountered challenges such as coding 
intricacies and visibility issues on the hosting platform. However, through collaborative efforts and strategic problem-solving, we successfully overcame each obstacle, ensuring the final product met our standards of excellence.

Hosting Platform: The website is hosted on Hostinger, leveraging its robust hosting platform. This choice ensures the website's stability, security, and efficient performance, contributing to a positive user experience.
